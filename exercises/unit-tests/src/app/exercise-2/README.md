## Exercise Two

The component in this folder has a property `message` and a dependency of `MessageService`.

In `exercise2.spec.ts`:
- Write a mock message service that returns a phrase of your choice (since the existing service is a mock, feel free to start there)
- Test that the contents of the element's `h2` match the expected phrase

Tests can be run from the `unit-tests` directory using the command `npm run test`
